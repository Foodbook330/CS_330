      Meat

    <div id = "foodbook-paragraph">
      Store raw meat (including poultry and seafood) on the bottom shelf of the refridgerator. This helps ensure that the juices do not drip onto the other foods and contaminate them. Most raw meat can be stored in the refrigerator for 3-5 days. Groud meat, however, should only be kept for 1-2 days. Raw roasts, steaks, and chops can be kept in the freezer for up to a year. Uncooked, frozen ground meat can be kept for 4 months, and frozen cooked meat can be kept for 3 months.

      Vegetables
    </div>
    <div id = "foodbook-paragraph">
      Leafy greens stay fresh the longest when rinsed and stored in a sealed container in the refridgerator. Before placing them in a container, wrap them in paper towel for best results. These vegetables stay good for around 4-6 days. Root vegetables should be stored in a cool, dark, dry spot not in the refrigerator. A good place to store these vegetables and others (such as onions, garlic, potatoes, yams, and pumpkins) would be in your pantry or in a dark cupboard.

      Fruits
    </div>
    <div id = "foodbook-paragraph">
      Fresh fruits should be used within a few days of buying. If the fruit needs to be ripened, leave them out at room temperature, the store in the refrigerator. Frozen fruit should be stored in the freezer. Most frozen fruits can last for up to 6 months. Canned fruits can be stored at room temperature and many have a shelf life of up to 2 years. Dried fruit should be stored in a cool, dark place (warm temperatures make these foods spoil faster). Dried fruit normally lasts between 4 months and 1 year.

      Grains
    </div>
    <div id = "foodbook-paragraph">
      The shelf life of whole intact grains, like wheat berries or brown rice, if stored properly in airtight containers, is up to 6 months in a cool, dry pantry shelf or up to a year in the freezer. If stored properly in airtight containers, most whole grain flours and meals will keep for 1 to 3 months in a cool dry pantry shelf or 2 to 6 months in the freezer.
